    - "HIGH: An integer overflow vulnerability was identified in GitHub's markdown parser that could potentially lead to information leaks and RCE. This vulnerability was reported through the GitHub Bug Bounty program by Felix Wilhelm of Google's Project Zero and has been assigned CVE-2022-24724."
  bugs:
    - Upgrades could sometimes fail if a high-availability replica's clock was out of sync with the primary. 
    - OAuth Applications created after September 1st, 2020 were not able to use the [Check an Authorization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/apps#check-an-authorization) API endpoint. 
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
