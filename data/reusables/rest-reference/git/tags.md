## Tags

A Git tag is similar to a [Git reference](/rest/reference/git#refs), but the Git commit that it points to never changes. Git tags are helpful when you want to point to specific releases. These endpoints allow you to read and write [tag objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-References#Tags) to your Git database on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. The Git tags API only supports [annotated tag objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-References#Tags), not lightweight tags.
