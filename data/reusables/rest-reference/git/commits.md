## Commits

A Git commit is a snapshot of the hierarchy ([Git tree](/rest/reference/git#trees)) and the contents of the files ([Git blob](/rest/reference/git#blobs)) in a Git repository.
These endpoints allow you to read and write [commit objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#Commit-Objects)
to your Git database on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
