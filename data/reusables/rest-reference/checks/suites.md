## Check Suites

{% note %}

  **Note:** A GitHub App only receives one [`check_suite`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_suite) event per commit SHA, even if you push the commit SHA to more than one branch. To find out when a commit SHA is pushed to a branch, you can subscribe to branch [`create`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#create) events.
