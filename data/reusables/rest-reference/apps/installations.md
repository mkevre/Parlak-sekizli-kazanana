## Installations

The Installations API enables you to get information about installations of your GitHub App and perform actions within those installations. An _installation_ refers to any user or organization account that has installed the app. For information on how to authenticate as an installation and limit access to specific repositories, see "[Authenticating as an installation](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation)."

To list all GitHub App installations for an organization, see "[List app installations for an organization](/rest/reference/orgs#list-app-installations-for-an-organization)."
