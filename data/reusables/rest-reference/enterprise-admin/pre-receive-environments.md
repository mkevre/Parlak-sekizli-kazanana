## Pre-receive environments

The Pre-receive Environments API allows you to create, list, update and delete environments for pre-receive hooks. *It is only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) site administrators.* Normal users will receive a `404` response if they try to access it.
