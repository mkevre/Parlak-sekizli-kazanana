## Discussions

The team discussions API allows you to get, create, edit, and delete discussion posts on a team's page. You can use team discussions to have conversations that are not specific to a repository or project. Any member of the team's [organization](/rest/reference/orgs) can create and read public discussion posts. For more details, see "[About team discussions](//organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions/)." To learn more about commenting on a discussion post, see the [team discussion comments API](/rest/reference/teams#discussion-comments). This API is only available to authenticated members of the team's organization.
