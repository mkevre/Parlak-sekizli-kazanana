## Discussion comments

The team discussion comments API allows you to get, create, edit, and delete discussion comments on a [team discussion](/rest/reference/teams#discussions) post. Any member of the team's [organization](/rest/reference/orgs) can create and read comments on a public discussion. For more details, see "[About team discussions](/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions/)." This API is only available to authenticated members of the team's organization.
