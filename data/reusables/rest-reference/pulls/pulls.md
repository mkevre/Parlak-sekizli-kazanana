The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the [Issue Comments API](/rest/reference/issues#comments).

Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like manipulating assignees, labels and milestones, are provided within [the Issues API](/rest/reference/issues).

### Custom media types for pull requests

These are the supported media types for pull requests.

    application/vnd.github.VERSION.raw+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.text+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.html+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.full+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.diff
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.patch

For more information, see "[Custom media types](/rest/overview/media-types)."

If a diff is corrupt, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}. Include the repository name and pull request ID in your message.
