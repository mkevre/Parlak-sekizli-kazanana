If you want to authenticate some users without adding them to your identity provider, you can configure built-in authentication in addition to SAML SSO. For more information, see "[Allowing built-in authentication for users outside your identity provider](/admin/identity-and-access-management/authenticating-users-for-your-github-enterprise-server-instance/allowing-built-in-authentication-for-users-outside-your-identity-provider)."
