You can filter files in a pull request by file extension type, such as `.html` or `.js`, lack of an extension, code ownership, or dotfiles.{% if pr-tree-view %} You can also use the file tree to filter by file path, navigate between files, or see a high level view of the changed files.{% endif %}

## Using the file filter dropdown

{% tip %}

**Tip:** To simplify your pull request diff view, you can also temporarily hide deleted files or files you have already viewed in the pull request diff from the file filter drop-down menu.

{% endtip %}

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %}
2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to filter.
{% data reusables.repositories.changed-files %}
4. Use the File filter drop-down menu, and select, unselect, or click the desired filters.

5. Optionally, to clear the filter selection, under the **Files changed** tab, click **Clear**.

{% if pr-tree-view %}
## Using the file tree

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %}
1. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to filter.
{% data reusables.repositories.changed-files %}
1. If the file tree is hidden, click **Show file tree** to display the file tree.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: The file tree will not display if your screen width is too narrow or if the pull request only includes one file.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click on a file in the file tree to view the corresponding file diff.

1. To filter by file path, enter part or all of the file path in the **Filter changed files** search box. Alternatively, use the file filter dropdown. For more information, see "[Using the file filter dropdown](#using-the-file-filter-dropdown)."
