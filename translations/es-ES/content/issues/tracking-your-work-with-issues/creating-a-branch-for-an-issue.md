## About branches connected to an issue
Branches connected to an issue are shown under the "Development" section in the sidebar of an issue. When you create a pull request for one of these branches, it is automatically linked to the issue. The connection with that branch is removed and only the pull request is shown in the "Development" section.

## Creating a branch for an issue

Anyone with write permission to a repository can create a branch for an issue. You can link multiple branches for an issue.

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-issues %}
3. In the list of issues, click the issue that you would like to create a branch for.
4. In the right sidebar under "Development", click **Create a branch**. If the issue already has a linked branch or pull request, click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="The Gear icon" %} and at the bottom of the drop-down menu click **Create a branch**. ![Screenshot showing Create a branch option highlighted in sidebar](/assets/images/help/issues/create-a-branch.png)
