## About dependency review

{% data reusables.dependency-review.feature-overview %}

If a pull request targets your repository's default branch and contains changes to package manifests or lock files, you can display a dependency review to see what has changed. The dependency review includes details of changes to indirect dependencies in lock files, and it tells you if any of the added or updated dependencies contain known vulnerabilities.

{% ifversion fpt %}
Dependency review is available in all public repositories in all products and cannot be disabled. Dependency review is available in private repositories owned by organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and have a license for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review).

{% elsif ghec %}
Dependency review is included in {% data variables.product.product_name %} for public repositories. To use dependency review in private repositories owned by organizations, you must have a license for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} and have the dependency graph enabled. For more information, see "[Exploring the dependencies of a repository](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#enabling-and-disabling-the-dependency-graph-for-a-private-repository)."

{% elsif ghes or ghae %}
Dependency review is available when dependency graph is enabled for {% data variables.product.product_location %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} is enabled for the organization or repository.
{% endif %}

Sometimes you might just want to update the version of one dependency in a manifest and generate a pull request. However, if the updated version of this direct dependency also has updated dependencies, your pull request may have more changes than you expected. The dependency review for each manifest and lock file provides an easy way to see what has changed, and whether any of the new dependency versions contain known vulnerabilities.

By checking the dependency reviews in a pull request, and changing any dependencies that are flagged as vulnerable, you can avoid vulnerabilities being added to your project. For more information about how dependency review works, see "[Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request)."

{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} will find vulnerabilities that are already in your dependencies, but it's much better to avoid introducing potential problems than to fix problems at a later date. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies#dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

Dependency review supports the same languages and package management ecosystems as the dependency graph. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph#supported-package-ecosystems)."

## Enabling dependency review

The dependency review feature becomes available when you enable the dependency graph. {% ifversion ghec %}For more information, see "[Enabling the dependency graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph#enabling-the-dependency-graph)."{% endif %}{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}For more information, see "[Enabling the dependency graph for your enterprise](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-the-dependency-graph-for-your-enterprise)."{% endif %}
{% endif %}
