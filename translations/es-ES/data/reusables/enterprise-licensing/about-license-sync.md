{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} uses a unique-user licensing model, where each person only consumes one license, no matter how many {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances the person uses, or how many organizations the person is a member of on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. This model allows each person to use multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} environments without incurring extra costs.

For a person using multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} environments to only consume a single license, you must synchronize license usage between environments. Then, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will deduplicate users based on the email addresses associated with their personal accounts. Multiple personal accounts will consume a single license when there is a match between an account's primary email address on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} and/or an account's verified email address on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. For more information about verification of email addresses on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, see "[Verifying your email address](/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address){% ifversion not ghec %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}

When you synchronize license usage, only the user ID and email addresses for each personal account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} are transmitted to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.
