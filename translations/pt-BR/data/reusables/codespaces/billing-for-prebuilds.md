A {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow is triggered every time you create or update a prebuild template, or push to a prebuild-enabled branch. As with other workflows, while prebuild workflows are running they will either consume some of the Actions minutes included with your account, if you have any, or they will incur charges for Actions minutes. For more information about pricing for Actions minutes, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)."

If you are an organization owner, you can track usage of prebuild workflows by downloading a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage report for your organization. You can identify workflow runs for prebuilds by filtering the CSV output to only include the workflow called "Create Codespaces Prebuilds." Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Visualizar o uso do seu {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage#viewing-github-actions-usage-for-your-organization)".

While {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} prebuilds is in beta there is no charge for storage of templates. When prebuilds become generally available, you will be billed for storing prebuild templates for each prebuild configuration in each region selected for that configuration.
