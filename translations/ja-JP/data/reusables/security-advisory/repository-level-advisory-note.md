**Note**: This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as a repository owner.

Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository.
