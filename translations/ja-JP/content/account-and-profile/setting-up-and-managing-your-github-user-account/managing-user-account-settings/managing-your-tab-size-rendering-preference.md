If you feel that tabbed indentation in code rendered on {% data variables.product.product_name %} takes up too much, or too little space, you can change this in your settings.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. In the left sidebar, click **{% octicon "paintbrush" aria-label="The paintbrush icon" %} Appearance**.
2. Under "Tab size preference", select the drop-down menu and choose your preference. ![Tab size preference button](/assets/images/help/settings/tab-size-preference.png)
