You can use a recovery code to access your enterprise account when a SAML configuration error or an issue with your identity provider (IdP) prevents you from using SAML SSO.

In order to access your enterprise account this way, you must have previously downloaded and stored the recovery codes for your enterprise. For more information, see "[Downloading your enterprise account's SAML single sign-on recovery codes](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-recovery-codes-for-your-enterprise/downloading-your-enterprise-accounts-saml-single-sign-on-recovery-codes)."
