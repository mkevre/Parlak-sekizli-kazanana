## Marketplace

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, see "[GitHub Marketplace](/marketplace/)."

The {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API allows you to see which customers are using a pricing plan, see a customer's purchases, and see if an account has an active subscription.

### Testing with stubbed endpoints

This API includes endpoints that allow you to [test your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}](/marketplace/integrating-with-the-github-marketplace-api/testing-github-marketplace-apps/) with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is hard-coded, fake data that will not change based on actual subscriptions.

To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

Be sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}.
