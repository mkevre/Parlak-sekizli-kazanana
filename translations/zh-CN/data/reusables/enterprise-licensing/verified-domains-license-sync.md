{% note %}

**Note:** If you synchronize license usage and your enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} does not use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, we highly recommend enabling verified domains for your enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. For privacy reasons, your consumed license report only includes the email address associated with a personal account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} if the address is hosted by a verified domain. If one person is erroneously consuming multiple licenses, having access to the email address that is being used for deduplication makes troubleshooting much easier. For more information. see "[Verifying or approving a domain for your enterprise](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise)" and "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-with-enterprise-managed-users/about-enterprise-managed-users){% ifversion not ghec %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}
