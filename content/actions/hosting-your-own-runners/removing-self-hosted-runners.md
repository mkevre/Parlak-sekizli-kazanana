## Removing a runner from a repository

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-removal-impact %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-auto-removal %}

{% endnote %}

To remove a self-hosted runner from a user repository you must be the repository owner. For an organization repository, you must be an organization owner or have admin access to the repository. We recommend that you also have access to the self-hosted runner machine. For information about how to remove a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see "[Self-hosted runners](/rest/reference/actions#self-hosted-runners)."
