## About per-user pricing

New organizations on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} can build public and open-source projects with {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %}, or upgrade to a paid product with per-user pricing. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.company_short %}'s products](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products)" and "[Upgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} subscription](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/upgrading-your-github-subscription)."

{% ifversion ghec %}Per-user pricing applies to all organizations that belong to your enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, and to organizations using  {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} that are not part of an enterprise. Each{% elsif fpt %}Per-user pricing means that each{% endif %} billing cycle, {% data variables.product.company_short %} charges for each member or outside collaborator within your organization{% ifversion ghec %} or enterprise{% endif %}. You also pay for each pending member or outside collaborator who has not yet accepted an invitation. {% data variables.product.company_short %} does not charge for members with the billing manager role{% ifversion ghec %}, or for enterprise owners who are not also a member of at least one organization in the enterprise{% endif %}. For more information, see {% ifversion ghec %}"[Roles in an enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise)" or {% endif %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}"[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."{% endif %}

{% data variables.product.company_short %} counts each {% ifversion ghec %}member or {% endif %}outside collaborator once for billing purposes, even if the person has {% ifversion ghec %}membership in multiple organizations in an enterprise or {% endif %}access to multiple repositories owned by your organization.

For more information about outside collaborators, see "[Adding outside collaborators to repositories in your organization](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)."

### About changes for organizations on per-repository plans

You can upgrade or downgrade between legacy paid plans in your organization's billing settings. When you upgrade to a plan with more private repositories, {% data variables.product.company_short %} immediately moves your account to your new plan and bills you for the difference in price, prorated for the number of days left in your billing cycle.

When you downgrade to a legacy paid plan with fewer private repositories, your new plan will take effect on your next billing date. If you have more private repositories than your new plan allows for, your private repositories will be locked when your new plan takes effect. To reduce your number of private repositories, you can make some of your private repositories public, or you can clone your private repositories locally and delete the copies on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
