## About removal of enterprise members

When you remove an enterprise member from your enterprise, the member is removed from all organizations owned by your enterprise.

If the enterprise member you're removing is the last owner of an organization owned by your enterprise, you will become an owner of that organization.

If your enterprise or any of the organizations owned by your enterprise uses an identity provider (IdP) to manage organization membership, the member may be added back to the organization by the IdP. Make sure to also make any necessary changes in your IdP.

## Removing a member from your enterprise

{% note %}

**Note:** If an enterprise member uses only {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, and not {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you cannot remove the enterprise member this way.
