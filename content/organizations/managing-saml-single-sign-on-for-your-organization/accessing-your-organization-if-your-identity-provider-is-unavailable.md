Organization administrators can use [one of their downloaded or saved recovery codes](/articles/downloading-your-organization-s-saml-single-sign-on-recovery-codes) to bypass single sign-on. You may have saved these to a password manager, such as [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/).
