Organization owners can manage an organization's SSH certificate authorities (CA).

You can allow members to access your organization's repositories using SSH certificates you provide by adding an SSH CA to your organization. {% data reusables.organizations.can-require-ssh-cert %} For more information, see "[About SSH certificate authorities](/articles/about-ssh-certificate-authorities)."

{% data reusables.organizations.add-extension-to-cert %}

## Adding an SSH certificate authority

If you require SSH certificates for your enterprise, enterprise members should use a special URL for Git operations over SSH. For more information, see "[About SSH certificate authorities](/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/about-ssh-certificate-authorities#about-ssh-urls-with-ssh-certificates)."
