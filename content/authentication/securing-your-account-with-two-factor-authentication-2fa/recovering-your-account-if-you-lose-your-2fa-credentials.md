## Using a two-factor authentication recovery code

Use one of your recovery codes to automatically regain entry into your account. You may have saved your recovery codes to a password manager or your computer's downloads folder. The default filename for recovery codes is `github-recovery-codes.txt`. For more information about recovery codes, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication recovery methods](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods#downloading-your-two-factor-authentication-recovery-codes)."

1. Type your username and password to prompt authentication.

## Authenticating with a fallback number

If you lose access to your primary TOTP app or phone number, you can provide a two-factor authentication code sent to your fallback number to automatically regain access to your account.
{% endif %}

## Authenticating with a security key

If you configured two-factor authentication using a security key, you can use your security key as a secondary authentication method to automatically regain access to your account. For more information, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-security-key)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## Authenticating with a verified device, SSH token, or personal access token

If you know your password for {% data variables.product.product_location %} but don't have the two-factor authentication credentials or your two-factor authentication recovery codes, you can have a one-time password sent to your verified email address to begin the verification process and regain access to your account.

{% note %}

**Note**: For security reasons, regaining access to your account by authenticating with a one-time password can take up to three business days. {% data variables.product.company_short %} will not review additional requests submitted during this time.

{% endnote %}

You can use your two-factor authentication credentials or two-factor authentication recovery codes to regain access to your account anytime during the 3-5 day waiting period.

1. Type your username and password to prompt authentication.
