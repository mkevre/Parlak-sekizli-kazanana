## Viewing or copying the raw file content

With the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. Click the file that you want to view.
2. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click **Raw**.

3. Optionally, to copy the raw file content, in the upper-right corner of the file view, click **{% octicon "copy" aria-label="The copy icon" %}**.

## Viewing the line-by-line revision history for a file

With the blame view, you can view the line-by-line revision history for an entire file, or view the revision history of a single line within a file by clicking {% octicon "versions" aria-label="The prior blame icon" %}. Each time you click {% octicon "versions" aria-label="The prior blame icon" %}, you'll see the previous revision information for that line, including who committed the change and when.

In a file or pull request, you can also use the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab octicon" %} menu to view Git blame for a selected line or range of lines.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** On the command line, you can also use `git blame` to view the revision history of lines within a file. For more information, see [Git's `git blame` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

{% endtip %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
2. Click to open the file whose line history you want to view.
3. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click **Blame** to open the blame view.

4. To see earlier revisions of a specific line, or reblame, click {% octicon "versions" aria-label="The prior blame icon" %} until you've found the changes you're interested in viewing.

## Ignore commits in the blame view
{% note %}

**Note:** Ignoring commits in the blame view is currently in public beta and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

All revisions specified in the `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file, which must be in the root directory of your repository, are hidden from the blame view using Git's `git blame --ignore-revs-file` configuration setting. For more information, see [`git blame --ignore-revs-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt) in the Git documentation.

1. In the root directory of your repository, create a file named `.git-blame-ignore-revs`.
2. Add the commit hashes you want to exclude from the blame view to that file. We recommend the file to be structured as follows, including comments:

    ```ini
    # .git-blame-ignore-revs
    # Removed semi-colons from the entire codebase
    a8940f7fbddf7fad9d7d50014d4e8d46baf30592
    # Converted all JavaScript to TypeScript
    69d029cec8337c616552756310748c4a507bd75a
    ```

3. Commit and push the changes.

Now when you visit the blame view, the listed revisions will not be included in the blame. You'll see an **Ignoring revisions in .git-blame-ignore-revs** banner indicating that some commits may be hidden:

This can be useful when a few commits make extensive changes to your code. You can use the file when running `git blame` locally as well:

```shell
git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

{% endif %}
