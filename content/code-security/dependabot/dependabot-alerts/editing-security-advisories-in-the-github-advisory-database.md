You can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted.

4. In the contribution form, make the desired improvements. You can edit or add any detail.
5. When you finish editing the advisory, click **Submit improvements**.
6. Once you submit your improvements, a pull request containing your changes will be created for review in [github/advisory-database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database) by the {% data variables.product.prodname_security %} curation team. If the advisory originated from a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository, we will also tag the original publisher for optional commentary. You can view the pull request and get notifications when it is updated or closed.

You can also open a pull request directly on an advisory file in the [github/advisory-database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database) repository. For more information, see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
