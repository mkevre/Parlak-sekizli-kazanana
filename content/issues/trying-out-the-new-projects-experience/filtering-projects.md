## About filtering projects

You can customize views using filters for item metadata, such as assignees and the labels applied to issues, and by the fields in your project. You can combine filters and save them as views. For more information, see "[Customizing your project views](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/customizing-your-project-views)."

To filter a project, click {% octicon "filter" aria-label="The Filter icon" %} and start typing the fields and values you would like to filter for. As you type, possible values will appear. You can also open the command pallet and type "Filter by" to choose from the available filters.

The same filters are available for insights, allowing you to filter the data used to create your charts. For more information, see "[Using insights with projects](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/using-insights-with-projects)."
